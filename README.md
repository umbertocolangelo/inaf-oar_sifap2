# Study of FOBs with SiFAP2 Instrumentation

This project focuses on the analysis of Fast Optical Bursts (FOBs) detected using the SiFAP2 instrumentation. The main objectives are:

- **Detecting the transit of new objects** in the observed space,  
- **Cleaning the dataset** of historical measurements,  
- **Distinguishing between FOBs from astrophysical events of interest** and transits of man-made objects, such as satellites and space debris,  
- **Separating useful signals from noise** produced by the instrumentation.

## Description

The SIFAP2 instrumentation provides highly sensitive data for monitoring luminous transits in space. The analysis aims to improve dataset quality by accurately identifying and classifying different types of observed events, thus facilitating scientific studies on real astrophysical phenomena and monitoring artificial space objects.

## Project Structure

- `scripts/` : data analysis and processing scripts  
- `data/` : raw and cleaned measurement data  
- `logs/` : log files for monitoring and debugging  
- `venv/` : Python virtual environment  

## Installation
